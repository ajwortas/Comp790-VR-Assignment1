# Comp790-VR-Assignment1
An introductory VR game made in unity. 

# Why this is a game based on our definitions:
Fixed rules: In this game you have 10 balls and need to try and hit the targets. Hitting a target allows you to score points based off of the difficulty of the shot. Harder shots give more points but you're more likely to miss.

Variable and quantifiable outcome: The score you get each time varies due to you being able to hit the shots and which targets you aim for.

Valorization of outcome: The score valorizes the outcome.

Player effort: players need skill in order to aim accurately for the targets 

Attachment of the player to the outcome: getting a higher score is better and feels better than a lower score.

Negotiable consequences: None in its current state but its structured like an arcade game where you might need to pay a quarter or something to play
